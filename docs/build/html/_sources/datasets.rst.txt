Datasets
========

Orange-Volcanoes already contains a collection of open-source petrological, volcanological, and experimental datasets that users can upload, investigate, analyze, and combine. It is possible to easily access them through the "Dataset" widget, contained in the Orange-Volcanoes Add-on (Figure 3).

The open source databases available in Orange-Volcanoes are updated and new datasets added regularly. In the current version of Orange, the datasets present are:

- **LEPR dataset:** LEPR (hirschmann_library_2008) is a database that compiles the results of published experimental studies on liquid-solid phase equilibria relevant to natural magmatic systems. It is being developed and made accessible to the community through the `this website <https://lepr.earthchem.org/access_user/login.php>`_.

- **Ágreda López et al., 2024:** The database of Ágreda López et al., 2024 is a filtered version of the large Experimental dataset presented in (jorgenson_machine_2022) specifically refined for training the latest ML-based Thermobarometers. Both (agreda-lopez_enhancing_2024) and (jorgenson_machine_2022) are based on the LEPR dataset (hirschmann_library_2008).

- **Smith et al., 2011:** The Smith et al., 2011 dataset consists of a large collection of glass chemical compositions from shards erupted during the different eruptive epochs of the Phlegraean Fields (Campania, Italy).
