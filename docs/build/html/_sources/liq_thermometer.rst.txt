LiqThermometer
==============

This widget calculates the temperature of liquid equilibrium with different mineralogical phases using only the liquidâ€™s chemical composition.

The widget uses the `Thermobar <https://www.jvolcanica.org/ojs/index.php/volcanica/article/view/161>`_ tool to function and requires a dataset prepared in a specific way (with specific variable labels). An example of how variables should be renamed before using the widget is shown in Table 1. More details can be found by consulting the Thermobar `documentation <https://thermobar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

As shown in Figure 9, users can select the thermometer formula that best suits their dataset via a convenient drop-down menu. If the chosen formula is pressure-dependent, the user can choose whether to (i) use pressure values found in a specific column within their dataset, (ii) enter a specific pressure to apply to the entire dataset, or (iii) calculate their own pressure from a specific model.
